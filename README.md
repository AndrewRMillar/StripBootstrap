# StripBootstrap
Strip Bootstrap of the bloat your site doesn't need

I never completed this project and BS 3 lets you select which parts you need: <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/customize/>. I am abandoning this project. For that matter, using regexp to selectively strip bootstrap was perhaps not the best idea.
